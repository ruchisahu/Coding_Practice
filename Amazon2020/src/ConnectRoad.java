/*
 * Amazon is working on creating a road network to connect all their warehouses to help in transferring
products between them. The proposed road network guarantees that all the warehouses will be connected
to each other directly or indirectly. A road can be classified as "critical" or "non-critical". A road is considered
"critical" if its removal results in a disconnected network of warehouses. Amazon wants to significantly
increase the efficiency of their warehouse network by investing in better infrastructure to build those roads.
Write a method that returns the critical connections from the proposed connections.
Input
The input to the function/method consists of three arguments -
numOfWarehouses, an integer representing the number of warehouses in the proposed plan;
numOfRoads, an integer representing the number of roads between the warehouses;
roads, a list of pairs of integers representing the roads between two warehouses.
Output
Return a list of integer pairs representing the critical connections. If there are no critical connections, return
a list with empty pair - not just an empty list.

I/P : numOfWarehouses = 5
numOfRoads=5
roads = [[1,2],[1,3],[3,4],[1,4],[4,5]]

0/P: [[1,2],[4,5]]
