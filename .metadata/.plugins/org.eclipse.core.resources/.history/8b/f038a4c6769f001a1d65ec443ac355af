/*
 * Given a list of reviews, a list of keywords and an integer k. Find the most popular k keywords in order of most to least frequently mentioned.

The comparison of strings is case-insensitive.
Multiple occurances of a keyword in a review should be considred as a single mention.
If keywords are mentioned an equal number of times in reviews, sort alphabetically.

Example 1:

Input:
k = 2
keywords = ["anacell", "cetracular", "betacellular"]
reviews = [
  "Anacell provides the best services in the city",
  "betacellular has awesome services",
  "Best services provided by anacell, everyone should use anacell",
]

Output:
["anacell", "betacellular"]

Explanation:
"anacell" is occuring in 2 different reviews and "betacellular" is only occuring in 1 review.
