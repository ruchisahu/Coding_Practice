 * 
 *Problem statement:

There's a website "Amazon.com".
When a customer logs-in on Amazon.com, a new line "<customerId>,<timestamp>" is added to a log file and saved on a disk, for example:

"""
1,1590529992
100,1590529993
1,1590529994
2,1590529995
"""

One log file has entries for only 1 hour.

Log files are stored in directories - 24 log files per directory:
/logs/2018-01-01/
    2018-01-01-00:00.log ()
    2018-01-01-01:00.log
    2018-01-01-02:00.log
    ...
    2018-01-01-23:00.log
/logs/2018-01-02/
    ...


Write a method to find customers who logged-in on Amazon.com "X" times (2, 14 or any other number of times) for the past 24 hours
